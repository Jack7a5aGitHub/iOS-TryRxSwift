# iOS-TryRxSwift

First time to use RxSWift which is useful for building responsive app.

```swift

//MARK: - Rx Setup
    // asObservable - emit notifications of change
    // asObserver - which is observable, in order to be notified when it has changed.
    // You can have multiple Observers listening to an Observable. This means that when the Observable changes,
    // it will notify all its Observers.
    //value is where array of object is stored
    //closure inside onNext will be excuted every time the value change
    //disposed - handle the memory
    // subscribe - do changes according to the observable object
    
```
